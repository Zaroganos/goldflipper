### Key Benefits
- **Profit Maximization**: Capture extended trends beyond initial TP targets
- **Risk Reduction**: Protect profits with automatic stop adjustments
- **Automation**: Reduce manual intervention in position management
- **Flexibility**: Multiple trailing strategies (percentage, ATR, fixed amount)

### Scope
- Enhance existing play structure with trailing configurations
- Implement real-time trail level calculations and updates
- Integrate with existing monitoring and execution systems
- Provide user interfaces for trailing configuration and monitoring

## Current System Analysis

### Architecture Overview
```
Plays Directory Structure:
├── new/           # Plays awaiting entry conditions
├── open/          # Active positions being monitored
├── pending-opening/   # Orders submitted but not filled
├── pending-closing/   # Exit orders submitted but not filled
└── closed/        # Completed trades
```

### Key Components
1. **Play Structure**: JSON-based trade definitions with static TP/SL
2. **Monitoring Loop**: `monitor_plays_continuously()` checks conditions every cycle
3. **Condition Evaluation**: `evaluate_closing_strategy()` determines exit triggers
4. **Data Providers**: Real-time market data from Alpaca, YFinance, MarketDataApp
5. **Order Management**: Integration with Alpaca API for trade execution

### Current Limitations
- **Static Targets**: TP/SL levels set once at entry, never adjusted
- **No Trend Following**: Cannot capitalize on extended favorable moves
- **Fixed Risk/Reward**: Rigid profit-taking regardless of market conditions
- **Manual Adjustments**: No automated position management features

## Technical Design

### Trail Calculation Engine

#### Core Components
```
TrailingManager
├── TrailingCalculator      # Core calculation logic
├── TrailStateManager       # Persistence and state management
├── TrailConfigValidator    # Configuration validation
└── TrailHistoryLogger      # Audit trail and history
```

#### Trail Types Implementation

##### 1. Percentage-Based Trailing
```pseudocode
FUNCTION calculate_percentage_trail(current_price, trail_percentage, trade_type, peak_price):
    IF trade_type == "CALL":
        trail_level = peak_price * (1 - trail_percentage/100)
    ELSE:  // PUT
        trail_level = peak_price * (1 + trail_percentage/100)
    RETURN trail_level
```

##### 2. ATR-Based Trailing
```pseudocode
FUNCTION calculate_atr_trail(symbol, atr_multiplier, atr_period, trade_type, peak_price):
    atr_value = get_atr(symbol, atr_period)
    trail_distance = atr_value * atr_multiplier
    
    IF trade_type == "CALL":
        trail_level = peak_price - trail_distance
    ELSE:  // PUT
        trail_level = peak_price + trail_distance
    RETURN trail_level
```

##### 3. Fixed Amount Trailing
```pseudocode
FUNCTION calculate_fixed_trail(fixed_amount, trade_type, peak_price):
    IF trade_type == "CALL":
        trail_level = peak_price - fixed_amount
    ELSE:  // PUT
        trail_level = peak_price + fixed_amount
    RETURN trail_level
```

### Trail Update Logic
```pseudocode
FUNCTION update_trailing_levels(play, current_stock_price, current_premium):
    // Update peak favorable price tracking
    IF should_update_peak_price(current_stock_price, play):
        update_peak_price(play, current_stock_price)
    
    // Check and update trailing TP
    IF trailing_tp_enabled(play):
        new_tp_level = calculate_new_trail_level(play.take_profit.trailing_config)
        IF new_tp_level != play.take_profit.current_trail_level:
            update_trail_level(play, "TP", new_tp_level)
            log_trail_adjustment(play, "TP", new_tp_level)
    
    // Check and update trailing SL
    IF trailing_sl_enabled(play):
        new_sl_level = calculate_new_trail_level(play.stop_loss.trailing_config)
        IF new_sl_level != play.stop_loss.current_trail_level:
            update_trail_level(play, "SL", new_sl_level)
            log_trail_adjustment(play, "SL", new_sl_level)
```

### Integration with Existing Condition Evaluation
```pseudocode
FUNCTION evaluate_closing_strategy_enhanced(symbol, play):
    // Existing static condition checks
    static_conditions = evaluate_static_conditions(symbol, play)
    
    // New trailing condition checks
    trailing_conditions = {
        'tp_triggered': false,
        'sl_triggered': false
    }
    
    IF trailing_tp_enabled(play):
        current_price = get_current_price(symbol)
        trailing_conditions.tp_triggered = check_trailing_tp_trigger(current_price, play)
    
    IF trailing_sl_enabled(play):
        trailing_conditions.sl_triggered = check_trailing_sl_trigger(current_price, play)
    
    // Combine conditions
    RETURN combine_conditions(static_conditions, trailing_conditions)
```

## Integration Strategy

### Integration Points

#### 1. Core Monitoring Loop
```pseudocode
// In monitor_and_manage_position()
BEFORE condition evaluation:
    IF has_trailing_enabled(play):
        update_trailing_levels(play, current_price, current_premium)
        save_trail_state(play, play_file)
```

#### 2. Condition Evaluation
```pseudocode
// In evaluate_closing_strategy()
AFTER static condition checks:
    IF trailing_enabled:
        trail_conditions = evaluate_trailing_conditions(play, current_price)
        merge_conditions(static_conditions, trail_conditions)
```

#### 3. Order Execution
```pseudocode
// In close_position()
WHEN creating exit orders:
    IF trailing_triggered:
        use_trail_level_as_limit_price(play.trail_state.current_trail_level)
        log_trail_execution(play, "triggered")
```

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- All trailing fields optional with default `enabled: false`
- Existing plays continue to function without modification
- Migration utility to add trailing fields to legacy plays
- Graceful degradation when trailing data is missing

### Error Handling Strategy
- Trail calculation failures fall back to static levels
- Data feed interruptions pause trail updates, don't reset trails
- Invalid trail configurations disable trailing with warnings
- Trail state corruption recovery using last known good state
