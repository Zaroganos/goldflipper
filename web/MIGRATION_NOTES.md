  - Configured development and production dependencies
  - Set up Poetry scripts for main entry points
  - Added Poetry-specific files to `.gitignore`
  - Updated installation scripts to use Poetry
  - Configured VS Code for Poetry environment

- [ ] Update main `requirements.txt`:
  - Remove `requirements.txt` (replaced by Poetry)
  - Keep `setup.py` temporarily as backup
  - Remove `textual` and related dependencies
  - Add Streamlit and its dependencies
  - Update version constraints for shared dependencies

## IDE Configuration
- [x] Set up VS Code for Poetry:
  - Added `.vscode/settings.json` with Poetry environment path
  - Configured Python analysis settings
  - Set up package indexing for goldflipper
  - Added workspace folder to Python path
  - Enabled type checking and auto-imports

## File Structure Changes
- [ ] Remove old UI files:
  - `goldflipper_tui.py`
  - `goldflipper_tui_NEW.py`
  - `first_run_setup.py` (replace with Streamlit-based setup)
  - Any other UI-specific files

- [ ] Update import paths in core files:
  - Update any imports referencing old UI components
  - Ensure all core functionality is properly exposed to web interface

## Configuration Changes
- [ ] Update `settings.yaml`:
  - Add web-specific settings (port, host, etc.)
  - Remove any TUI-specific settings
  - Add new UI preferences

## Launch Scripts
- [x] Update launch scripts for Poetry:
  - Modified `install_service.bat` to use Poetry
  - Updated `launch_web.py` to use Poetry environment
  - Added Poetry installation checks
  - Improved error handling and logging

- [ ] Update `launch_goldflipper.bat`:
  - Replace TUI launch with web interface launch
  - Add proper error handling
  - Add web browser auto-launch

- [ ] Create Linux launch script:
  - Create `launch_goldflipper.sh`
  - Add proper permissions handling
  - Add web browser auto-launch

## Service Integration
- [ ] Update Windows service:
  - Modify service to launch web interface instead of TUI
  - Update service dependencies
  - Add web server status monitoring

- [ ] Update Linux systemd service:
  - Create/modify service file
  - Add web server configuration
  - Add proper logging

## Packaging Changes
- [ ] Update PyInstaller spec:
  - Remove TUI-specific files
  - Add web interface files
  - Update data files list
  - Add web server dependencies

- [ ] Consider alternative packaging:
  - Evaluate py2exe vs PyInstaller
  - Consider Docker containerization
  - Plan for cross-platform distribution

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Update test suite:
  - Add web interface tests
  - Add integration tests
  - Add performance tests
  - Add browser compatibility tests

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update user documentation:
  - Add web interface guide
  - Update installation instructions
  - Add troubleshooting guide
  - Update service management docs

## Deployment Strategy
- [ ] Plan deployment phases:
  1. Parallel deployment (both UIs)
  2. Gradual user transition
  3. Monitoring period
  4. Complete switchover

## Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Update backup procedures:
  - Add web interface state backup
  - Add session data backup
  - Update recovery procedures

## Security Considerations
- [ ] Add web security measures:
  - Add authentication
  - Add HTTPS support
  - Add rate limiting
  - Add input validation

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize web interface:
  - Add caching
  - Optimize data loading
  - Add lazy loading
  - Implement WebSocket for real-time updates

## Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Update logging system:
  - Add web interface logs
  - Add access logs
  - Add performance metrics
  - Add error tracking

## Future Considerations
- [ ] Plan for future improvements:
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - Progressive Web App features
  - Offline capabilities
  - API development

## Lessons Learned
1. Poetry Integration:
   - Poetry provides better dependency resolution than pip
   - Virtual environment management is automatic and reliable
   - Package versioning is more consistent
   - Development vs production dependencies are clearly separated

2. IDE Configuration:
   - VS Code needs explicit configuration for Poetry environments
   - Package indexing depth needs to be set appropriately
   - Workspace folder needs to be added to Python path
   - Type checking and auto-imports improve development experience

3. Migration Strategy:
   - Keep old dependency files as backup during transition
   - Update scripts gradually to use Poetry
   - Test each component after migration
   - Document all changes for team reference

4. Next Steps:
   - Complete removal of old UI files
   - Update import paths in core files
   - Migrate remaining scripts to Poetry
   - Update documentation for new setup
