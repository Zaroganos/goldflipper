# Streamlit Migration Progress

## Settings Page Implementation (Session: 2023-10-XX)

### Accomplished:

1. **Settings Page UI**
   - Created Streamlit settings page with tabbed interface
   - Implemented logging, market data, trading, and system settings tabs
   - Added proper input controls for all settings types (dropdowns, toggles, text inputs)
   - Created save functionality to update settings.yaml

2. **YAML Settings Integration**
   - Implemented direct YAML file loading and parsing
   - Added support for finding settings.yaml in multiple possible locations
   - Implemented settings display and editing from YAML
   - Added save-to-YAML functionality

3. **DuckDB Integration (Partial)**
   - Created database migration script to set up settings tables
   - Defined settings_schema and user_settings tables
   - Implemented SettingsManager class for database interaction
   - Added YAML-to-database import functionality
   - Set up database connection management

### Issues Encountered:

1. **DuckDB Compatibility Issues**
   - Found issues with SQL syntax between SQLAlchemy and DuckDB
   - Encountered problems with named parameters in SQL statements
   - Needed to explicitly use text() for SQL expressions
   - Had trouble with unique constraints and conflict resolution

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Encountered issues with session management and transactions
   - Found problems with database connection context management
   - Had challenges with rollback functionality

### Current Solution:

1. **Hybrid Approach**

   - Maintained full settings editing and saving functionality

### Next Steps:

1. **Complete Database Integration**
   - Fix remaining DuckDB compatibility issues
   - Implement proper transaction handling
   - Add complete bidirectional sync between DB and YAML
   - Add schema validation for settings

2. **Performance and Reliability**
   - Add proper error handling and recovery
   - Implement caching for better performance
   - Add detailed logging throughout
   - Create automated tests for settings functionality

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add schema-based validation of settings values
   - Implement settings versioning and migration
   - Create settings backup and restore functionality
   - Add settings search and filtering
