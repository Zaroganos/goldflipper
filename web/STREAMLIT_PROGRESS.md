# Streamlit Migration Progress

## WEM Module Implementation (Session: 2025-03-XX)

### Accomplished:

1. **WEM Data Visualization**
   - Created Weekly Expected Moves (WEM) analysis page
   - Implemented both horizontal and vertical table layouts
   - Added flexible metric selection with reordering capability
   - Added responsive table styling with proper headers and formatting

2. **Database Integration**
   - Implemented computed property approach for WEM value calculation
   - Enhanced database model to handle missing column gracefully
   - Added proper date range and symbol filtering
   - Implemented stock management (adding/viewing stocks)

3. **Data Processing**
   - Created robust calculation for WEM values based on straddle/strangle data
   - Added automatic data refresh with on-demand updates
   - Implemented data export to CSV and Excel formats
   - Enhanced error handling and validation throughout

### Issues Encountered:

1. **Database Schema Challenges**
   - Encountered issues with missing columns in the database
   - Had to implement graceful handling of schema differences
   - Needed to calculate derived values on-the-fly

2. **Layout and Display Issues**
   - Found challenges with transposed dataframe filtering
   - Had to handle symbol column differently between layouts
   - Needed special handling for datetime columns in the tables

### Current Solution:

1. **Hybrid Model-View Approach**
   - Computation of WEM values happens at multiple levels for resilience
   - Table data is processed in memory to handle different layouts
   - Database model contains fallback mechanisms for missing data
   - UI provides clear visual indication of data status and filtering

### Next Steps:

1. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Add historical WEM comparison charts
   - Implement alerts for significant WEM changes
   - Add pattern recognition for notable market events
   - Create benchmarking against sector/market averages

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Optimize database queries for larger datasets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add background updates for near-real-time data
   - Improve export formatting and options

## Settings Page Implementation (Session: 2023-10-XX)

### Accomplished:

1. **Settings Page UI**
   - Created Streamlit settings page with tabbed interface
   - Implemented logging, market data, trading, and system settings tabs
   - Added proper input controls for all settings types (dropdowns, toggles, text inputs)
   - Created save functionality to update settings.yaml

2. **YAML Settings Integration**
   - Implemented direct YAML file loading and parsing
   - Added support for finding settings.yaml in multiple possible locations
   - Implemented settings display and editing from YAML
   - Added save-to-YAML functionality

3. **DuckDB Integration (Partial)**
   - Created database migration script to set up settings tables
   - Defined settings_schema and user_settings tables
   - Implemented SettingsManager class for database interaction
   - Added YAML-to-database import functionality
   - Set up database connection management

### Issues Encountered:

1. **DuckDB Compatibility Issues**
   - Found issues with SQL syntax between SQLAlchemy and DuckDB
   - Encountered problems with named parameters in SQL statements
   - Needed to explicitly use text() for SQL expressions
   - Had trouble with unique constraints and conflict resolution

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Encountered issues with session management and transactions
   - Found problems with database connection context management
   - Had challenges with rollback functionality

### Current Solution:

1. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Settings page now loads directly from YAML file (working reliably)
   - Added optional database integration via sidebar buttons
   - Provided ability to initialize database and import settings
   - Maintained full settings editing and saving functionality

### Next Steps:

1. **Complete Database Integration**
   - Fix remaining DuckDB compatibility issues
   - Implement proper transaction handling
   - Add complete bidirectional sync between DB and YAML
   - Add schema validation for settings

2. **Performance and Reliability**
   - Add proper error handling and recovery
   - Implement caching for better performance
   - Add detailed logging throughout
   - Create automated tests for settings functionality

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add schema-based validation of settings values
   - Implement settings versioning and migration
   - Create settings backup and restore functionality
   - Add settings search and filtering
