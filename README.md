Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

    Python 3.8 or higher
    An Alpaca trading account with API access
    Required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

Install the required libraries:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure your API keys: Modify the config/config.py file with your Alpaca API keys:

python

    API_KEY = "your_api_key"
    SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
    BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"  # Use paper trading for testing

Running the System

To start the trading system, execute the main runner:

bash

python goldflipper.py

This script initializes the Alpaca client, loads the strategy, and begins executing trades based on the implemented logic.
