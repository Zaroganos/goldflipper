This is a list of tasks to do and features to implement for the goldflipper project.
Directions for AI: Place new tasks on top. Remember to use real current date when adding a to do or addressing it. Use a tool or MCP if you are unsure what the current date is.

### 2025-08-12
- [x] Migrated dependency management to uv
  - Converted `pyproject.toml` to PEP 621 `[project]` with `[dependency-groups]`
  - Switched build backend to Hatch (`hatchling`) and configured wheel packages
  - Replaced Poetry/pip usage in scripts with `uv sync` / `uv run`; added uv auto-install checks
  - Generated and committed `uv.lock` for reproducible installs
- [x] Updated documentation and messages to uv
  - `README.md`: Added ‚ÄúMigrating from Goldflipper Classic‚Äù with `uv run goldflipper-migrate`
  - `docs/developer_guide.md`, `web/MIGRATION_NOTES.md`: updated to uv
  - Replaced pip install tips with `uv pip install ...` in helper scripts/messages
- [x] Version resolution improvements
  - `database/connection.py`: read version from `[project].version` (fallback to Poetry), support normalized dist names
- [x] Validated environment
  - Ran `uv lock` and `uv sync`; basic import smoke test succeeded
- [ ] CI/CD (GitHub Actions) with uv
  - Research `astral-sh/setup-uv@v6`, caching, `uv sync --locked`, `uv run pytest`, lint/type checks, secrets
- [ ] Optional follow-ups
  - Review and clean any remaining Poetry references in historical notes
  - Consider adding explicit uv check to any other runner scripts if needed

### 2025-08-11
- [ ] Add a way to address log size. How to implement functional rotating log files? How to archive old ones?
 - [x] VIX WEM stabilization:
   - Implemented provider-guided Wednesday expiration selection with rule-based algorithm fallback
   - Robust ATM selection for VIX via min |call_mid ‚àí put_mid|
   - Denominator (Friday Close) priority: VX=F via yfinance ‚Üí ^VIX via yfinance ‚Üí direct Yahoo Chart API ‚Üí parity proxy (last resort)
   - Added base source notes to Excel export; added ‚ÄúClear WEM Cache‚Äù maintenance action
   - Deprecated vix_utils pricing; removed manager dependency on vix_utils for futures price

### 2025-08-10 Wrap-up (Delta-16 + Settings + VIX)

- **Delta-16 accuracy hardening (in progress)**: WEM now chooses the actual expiration date from provider listings (when available) before chain fetch. Remaining task: extract and enhance `validate_delta_16_quality()` into its own module with stronger checks (absolute-delta closeness per side, sign normalization, bounds/monotonicity, optional cross‚Äëprovider checks, theoretical‚Äëdelta fallback).
- **Strict DB-only settings migration**:
  - All market data configuration is now loaded from DuckDB `user_settings` only. No YAML fallbacks.
  - Settings UI (`web/pages/4_‚öôÔ∏è_Settings.py`) reads/writes keys under `market_data_providers.*` using DELETE‚ÜíINSERT upserts with JSON-encoded values.
  - Fixed duplicate Streamlit element IDs; improved error messaging to list failing keys.
- **Unified database pathing**:
  - Default DB base dir now uses OS-standard path (Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Goldflipper`; macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Goldflipper`; Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/goldflipper` or `~/.local/share/goldflipper`). Can be overridden via `GOLDFLIPPER_DATA_DIR` and `.env.bat`.
  - Added runtime support to change base dir (code supports `set_data_dir()`), pending UI.
- **MarketData.app integration**:
  - Implemented `get_option_chain` with explicit `side=call|put` and `expiration` per docs/Postman; `get_available_expirations` added.
  - `get_historical_data` handles index symbols (e.g., VIX) via `/indices/candles` first.
- **WEM fixes**:
  - Corrected metadata bug by using a single `calendar_next_friday` reference to avoid `UnboundLocalError` on `next_friday`.
  - Logging refined: if essential fields are missing, logs reflect partial/unsuccessful updates rather than success.
  - Excel export: highlight Delta-16 flagged cells in vertical layout when validation warns/errors.
- **VIX now works**:
  - Verified chain/historical retrieval via MarketData.app with correct endpoints and symbol handling.

Key paths/files:
- `goldflipper/web/pages/6_üìä_WEM.py`: provider‚Äëguided expiration, chain usage, Delta‚Äë16 plumbing, metadata fix (`calendar_next_friday`).
- `goldflipper/web/pages/4_‚öôÔ∏è_Settings.py`: DB‚Äëonly settings UI, unique checkbox keys, robust upsert.
- `goldflipper/goldflipper/data/market/manager.py`: DB‚Äëonly config load; `get_available_expirations` entrypoint.
- `goldflipper/goldflipper/data/market/providers/marketdataapp_provider.py`: expirations, chain with side, indices candles.
- `.env.bat`, `web/launch_web.bat`, `launch_goldflipper.bat`: centralized env sourcing.

Open next steps:
- Extract and enhance Delta‚Äë16 validation module; wire highlighting for horizontal layout.
- Add DB UI to change DB base directory (writes `.env.bat`, calls `set_data_dir()`).
- Implement expirations for Alpaca; bring yfinance chain as fallback; ensure symbol mapping coverage.


- [x] Fix WEM display and validation issues (2025-06-23):
      1. [x] Fixed WEM price source bug - mystery $305.95 vs correct Friday close $308.38

         - Added both sig_figs and max_digits controls in sidebar
      3. [x] Fixed Delta 16+/- validation system timing issue

-- Service Management Enhancements --

- Added a "Manage Service" button to the Goldflipper TUI (goldflipper_tui.py).
  - This button now presents a confirmation dialog with centered text.
  - The dialog clearly warns that administrative privileges are required and that changes (install/uninstall) will not take effect until a system reboot.

- For service installation:
  - The elevated process installs the service and automatically starts it (via a PowerShell command that executes "python -m goldflipper.run --mode install" followed by "net start GoldflipperService").

- For service uninstallation:
  - The elevated process stops the running service before uninstalling it (via a PowerShell command that executes "net stop GoldflipperService" followed by "python -m goldflipper.run --mode remove").

- These changes improve user clarity and ensure that service state actions are performed safely and with the proper permissions.
