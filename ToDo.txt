- [?] Fix the problem with plays whose limit order is not filled and expires at the end of the day:
      1. ✓ Implement atomic file operations for all play file writes
      2. ✓ Add file backups before critical operations
      3. ✓ Add validation checks before saving play data
      4. ✓ Add integrity verification for play files
      5. ✓ Implement proper error handling and recovery for corrupted files
      - Additional improvements:
        - Updated directory paths
        - Removed unnecessary order cancellation for GTD orders
        - Enhanced logging and error reporting

- [ ] Implement a packaging and installation system for the program:
      1. Create spec file for PyInstaller with all dependencies
      2. Add data files to spec (config files, templates, etc.)
      3. Set up proper file paths for packaged version
      4. Create separate builds for Windows and Linux
      5. Add version checking and auto-update capability
      6. Create installation scripts for each platform
      7. Set up proper logging paths for installed version
      8. Integrate PyInstaller packaging to create standalone executables and test on target platforms

- [ ] Implement service functionality and resilience features:
      1. Set up Windows Service / Linux Systemd service:
         - Create service configuration files
         - Implement proper service lifecycle hooks (start, stop, pause, resume)
         - Configure service dependencies (network, filesystem)
         - Set up appropriate user permissions and security context
      
      2. Add automatic restart capabilities:
         - Implement watchdog functionality to monitor program health
         - Set up crash detection and reporting
         - Configure automatic restart on failure
         - Add exponential backoff for restart attempts
      
      3. Implement state recovery mechanisms:
         - Add periodic state snapshots
         - Implement transaction logging
         - Create state recovery procedures
         - Add consistency checks for recovered state
      
      4. Add system integration features:

         - Add administrative control interface
      
      5. Implement graceful shutdown handling:

         - Implement alert triggers for critical conditions
         - Add remote monitoring capability
         - Create status dashboard

-- Service Management Enhancements --

- Added a "Manage Service" button to the GoldFlipper TUI (goldflipper_tui.py).
  - This button now presents a confirmation dialog with centered text.
  - The dialog clearly warns that administrative privileges are required and that changes (install/uninstall) will not take effect until a system reboot.

- For service installation:
  - The elevated process installs the service and automatically starts it (via a PowerShell command that executes "python -m goldflipper.run --mode install" followed by "net start GoldFlipperService").

- For service uninstallation:
  - The elevated process stops the running service before uninstalling it (via a PowerShell command that executes "net stop GoldFlipperService" followed by "python -m goldflipper.run --mode remove").

- These changes improve user clarity and ensure that service state actions are performed safely and with the proper permissions.

- [x] Add limit orders at the 'last' price to the execution flow and play creation:
      1. ✓ Add price reference choice (bid/last) to play creation tool
      2. ✓ Update play data structure to store price reference
      3. ✓ Modify order execution logic to use selected price
      4. ✓ Add price reference validation in core functions
      5. ✓ Update logging to show price reference used
      6. ✓ Maintain backward compatibility for existing plays
