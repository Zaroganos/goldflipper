This is a list of things to do for the goldflipper project.

- [x] Add limit orders at the 'last' price to the execution flow and play creation:
      1. ✓ Add price reference choice (bid/last) to play creation tool
      2. ✓ Update play data structure to store price reference
      3. ✓ Modify order execution logic to use selected price
      4. ✓ Add price reference validation in core functions
      5. ✓ Update logging to show price reference used
      6. ✓ Maintain backward compatibility for existing plays

      
- [ ] Fix the problem with plays whose limit order is not filled and expires at the end of the day:
      1. ~~Implement atomic file operations for all play file writes~~ (Implemented in handle_end_of_day_pending_plays)
      2. ~~Add file backups before critical operations~~ (Implemented via save_play validation)
      3. ~~Add validation checks before saving play data~~ (Added load_play validation)
      4. ~~Add integrity verification for play files~~ (Added in handle_end_of_day_pending_plays)
      5. ~~Implement proper error handling and recovery for corrupted files~~ (Added comprehensive error handling)
      - Additional improvements:
        - Updated directory paths
        - Removed unnecessary order cancellation for GTD orders
        - Enhanced logging and error reporting


- [ ] Implement a packaging and installation system for the program:
      1. Create spec file for PyInstaller with all dependencies
      2. Add data files to spec (config files, templates, etc.)
      3. Set up proper file paths for packaged version
      4. Create separate builds for Windows and Linux
      5. Add version checking and auto-update capability
      6. Create installation scripts for each platform
      7. Set up proper logging paths for installed version
