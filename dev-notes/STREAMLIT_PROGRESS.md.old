# Streamlit Migration Progress

## Dynamic Table Sizing Implementation (Session: 2025-06-01)

### Accomplished:

1. **Dynamic Table Utilities**
   - Created comprehensive table utilities module (`goldflipper/web/utils/table_utils.py`)
   - Implemented automatic height calculation based on content
   - Added dynamic column width calculation based on content length
   - Created content optimization functions to remove empty rows/columns
   - Built responsive table configuration system

2. **WEM Page Enhancement**
   - Integrated dynamic table sizing into the WEM page
   - Added user controls for auto-sizing preferences (min/max height settings)
   - Implemented content-based table optimization
   - Enhanced table display with sizing information and status
   - Improved data filtering and validation

3. **General-Purpose Solution**
   - Created reusable utilities that can be applied to any Streamlit page
   - Added comprehensive documentation and usage examples
   - Implemented proper Python package structure with `__init__.py`
   - Designed utilities as drop-in replacement for `st.dataframe()`

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Tables now automatically size to their content (no extra rows/columns)
   - Added sidebar controls for sizing preferences
   - Improved table information display with sizing status
   - Enhanced responsiveness for different screen sizes

### Key Features:

1. **Automatic Sizing**
   - `calculate_dynamic_table_height()`: Calculates optimal height based on row count
   - `calculate_dynamic_column_widths()`: Determines column widths based on content
   - Configurable min/max bounds for height and width

2. **Content Optimization**
   - `optimize_table_for_content()`: Removes empty rows/columns
   - Filters data based on selected metrics
   - Handles both horizontal and vertical table layouts

3. **Responsive Configuration**
   - `get_responsive_table_config()`: Creates dynamic column configurations
   - Preserves existing formatting while adding responsive sizing
   - Supports both number and text column types

4. **User Controls**
   - Toggle between auto-sizing and fixed sizing
   - Adjustable min/max height settings
   - Real-time sizing information display

### Implementation Details:

1. **Table Height Calculation**
   ```python
   height = header_height + (row_count * row_height) + padding
   height = max(min_height, min(height, max_height))
   ```

2. **Column Width Calculation**
   ```python
   content_width = max_content_length * char_width + padding
   width = max(min_width, min(content_width, max_width))
   ```

3. **Content Optimization**
   - Removes completely empty rows: `df.dropna(how='all')`
   - Removes completely empty columns: `df.dropna(axis=1, how='all')`
   - Filters by available metrics to prevent errors

### Benefits:

1. **Improved UX**: No more scrolling through empty space
2. **Responsive Design**: Tables adapt to content and screen size
3. **Consistent Interface**: Standardized table display across pages
4. **User Control**: Optional manual sizing controls
5. **Performance**: Optimized data display reduces rendering overhead

### Next Steps:

1. **Apply to Other Pages**
   - Integrate dynamic sizing into Database page tables
   - Apply to Analysis page data displays
   - Update Trading page option chains

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add column sorting with preserved sizing
   - Implement table export with sizing preferences
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for sizing controls
   - Create table templates for common data types

## WEM Module Implementation (Session: 2025-03-XX)

### Accomplished:

1. **WEM Data Visualization**
   - Created Weekly Expected Moves (WEM) analysis page
   - Implemented both horizontal and vertical table layouts
   - Added flexible metric selection with reordering capability
   - Added responsive table styling with proper headers and formatting

2. **Market Data Integration**
   - Implemented real-time options data fetching from market data providers
   - Added ATM straddle calculation using actual mid prices
   - Implemented OTM strangle calculation with ~16 delta options
   - Calculated WEM values using real market pricing instead of simulations

3. **Database Integration**
   - Implemented computed property approach for WEM value calculation
   - Enhanced database model to handle missing column gracefully
   - Added proper date range and symbol filtering
   - Implemented stock management (adding/viewing stocks)

4. **Data Processing**
   - Created robust calculation for WEM values based on real market data
   - Added automatic data refresh with on-demand updates
   - Implemented data export to CSV and Excel formats
   - Enhanced error handling and validation throughout

### Issues Encountered:

1. **Database Schema Challenges**
   - Encountered issues with missing columns in the database
   - Had to implement graceful handling of schema differences
   - Needed to calculate derived values on-the-fly

2. **Layout and Display Issues**
   - Found challenges with transposed dataframe filtering
   - Had to handle symbol column differently between layouts
   - Needed special handling for datetime columns in the tables

### Current Solution:

1. **Hybrid Model-View Approach**
   - Computation of WEM values happens at multiple levels for resilience
   - Table data is processed in memory to handle different layouts
   - Database model contains fallback mechanisms for missing data
   - UI provides clear visual indication of data status and filtering

### Next Steps:

1. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Add historical WEM comparison charts
   - Implement alerts for significant WEM changes
   - Add pattern recognition for notable market events
   - Create benchmarking against sector/market averages

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Optimize database queries for larger datasets

   - Created save functionality to update settings.yaml

2. **YAML Settings Integration**
   - Implemented direct YAML file loading and parsing
   - Added support for finding settings.yaml in multiple possible locations
   - Implemented settings display and editing from YAML
   - Added save-to-YAML functionality

3. **DuckDB Integration (Partial)**
   - Created database migration script to set up settings tables
   - Defined settings_schema and user_settings tables
   - Implemented SettingsManager class for database interaction
   - Added YAML-to-database import functionality
   - Set up database connection management

### Issues Encountered:

1. **DuckDB Compatibility Issues**
   - Found issues with SQL syntax between SQLAlchemy and DuckDB
   - Encountered problems with named parameters in SQL statements
   - Needed to explicitly use text() for SQL expressions
   - Had trouble with unique constraints and conflict resolution

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Encountered issues with session management and transactions
   - Found problems with database connection context management
   - Had challenges with rollback functionality

   - Maintained full settings editing and saving functionality

### Next Steps:

1. **Complete Database Integration**
